# Two-Role Rebuild — Status Board

> Compact, current-state view. History + decisions live in [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) §6 (ledger).

## Where we are

**Wave 1 integration** on branch `two-role-rebuild` (never auto-deployed; main merges at W12 only).

## Migration chain (single head required)

`… → 0030 → 0031 (S1, IRREVERSIBLE) → 0032 → 0038 → 0039 → 0040 (S5) → 0033 → 0041 → 0042
→ 0044 → 0045 → 0046 → 0047 → 0048 → 0049 → 0050 → 0043 (NOT-NULL boundary LAST, Phase D, head)`

Confirm-fix reorder: 0044 (Phase-A `courses.quarantined`, referenced by visibility SQL) now
precedes the deferrable 0043 boundary; 0045 adds the moderation_events timestamp defaults
0033 omitted. `make migrate` = phase-safe; boundaries need `make migrate.phase` +
`ALLOW_PHASE_MIGRATION=1` (one boundary per run). Dev DB re-stamped through the reorder.

## Carry-forwards (owed, not lost)

- ~~PR-19 live no-KEK-with-credential boot check~~ — CLOSED at S5 Gate-C (prod+empty-KEK+credential
  rows → boot-guard refusal, live-verified 2026-06-03).
- ~~Suspended-user 401-vs-403 contract~~ — CLOSED at S6.7. `authenticate`/`rotate_refresh` now return
  **401** with distinct codes (`auth.account_suspended` for `is_active=False AND deleted_at IS NULL`;
  `auth.account_deleted` for the tombstone), replacing the generic `auth.inactive`; the
  suspended/deleted disclosure happens ONLY after a correct password (no enumeration oracle). The
  **403** half of the contract is the cooperative-cancel signal `account.access_revoked` raised by
  `account.assert_account_active` at streaming heartbeats + build/clone fences (S6.8). Tests:
  `test_auth_suspended_codes.py`, `test_cooperative_cancel.py`.
- Ingest "Import from URL" button visible to non-admin (API refuses; UI polish) — S2/S6.
- `feature_byok_enabled` default OFF — flip decision belongs to W12 release planning. Prod flip
  REQUIRES setting `BYOK_MASTER_KEYS={"1":"<b64 32B>"}` in .env.production first (boot guard).
- Streamed-turn `llm_calls` rows persist tokens=0 (usage tokens aren't plumbed through stream
  events yet) — token-window quota for streaming is COUNT-based only; plumb usage at S7 if wanted.

## Standing process rules

- Gates A+B+C green before a stream advances (charter §5).
- Gate-C auth = scripted Playwright storageState (`--project=setup`), never interactive
  multi-account credential fills (post-mortem in ledger 2026-06-03; memory
  `aup-block-multi-account-logins`).
- Local-first: full backend+frontend suites + lint before any push; CI gates prod.
